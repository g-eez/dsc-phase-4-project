    "1. **Build a sentiment analysis model** that classifies Tweets about Apple and Google as positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
    "2. **Start simple**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Begin with binary classification (positive vs. negative).\n",
    "   * Later expand to multiclass (positive, negative, neutral).\n",
    "3. **Iterate and improve**: experiment with different NLP approaches, including advanced methods suggested in the Mod 4 Appendix.\n",
    "4. **Deliver a proof of concept** (not a production system).\n",
    "5. **Evaluate the model carefully**:\n",
    "\n",

    "   * Choose evaluation metrics guided by the business problem the model addresses.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Business & Data Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Goal: Build a sentiment analysis model for Apple/Google-related tweets.\n",
    "   * Why this dataset works: It directly contains tweets labeled by sentiment and target products.\n",
    "   * Provide descriptive stats (class distribution, missing data).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preparation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Clean tweets: remove URLs, mentions, hashtags, punctuation, lowercasing.\n",
    "   * Handle missing values: drop or impute tweets with null labels.\n",
    "   * Text preprocessing: tokenize, remove stopwords, consider lemmatization.\n",
    "   * Convert text to numeric features: TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words, or embeddings.\n",
    "   * Document choices (e.g., why you removed stopwords).\n",
    "   * Tools: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk` or `spaCy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Modeling**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Start simple: Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes on TF-IDF features.\n",
    "   * Iterate: try more advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, or transformer embeddings like BERT).\n",
    "   * Tune hyperparameters (e.g., grid search).\n",
    "   * Tools: `scikit-learn`, possibly `transformers` (Hugging Face).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Split data into train/test (or use cross-validation).\n",
    "   * For binary: accuracy, precision, recall, F1.\n",
    "   * For multiclass: macro/micro F1, confusion matrix.\n",
    "   * Tie back to business: emphasize minimizing false negatives if negative sentiment is more critical.\n",

    "## Here’s the straight path from raw tweets to a functioning sentiment classifier using NLP:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Text Cleaning & Normalization**\n",
    "\n",
    "We strip the noise from tweets so the model focuses on meaning, not clutter.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Remove URLs, mentions (`@user`), hashtags, emojis, punctuation.\n",
    "* Lowercase everything.\n",
    "* Optional: expand contractions (`don’t → do not`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Tokenization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Break each tweet into units (words, subwords).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: `\"I love my iPhone\"` → `[\"i\", \"love\", \"my\", \"iphone\"]`.\n",
    "* Tools: `nltk`, `spaCy`, or `scikit-learn`’s built-in tokenizers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Stopword Handling**\n",
    "\n",
    "Decide what to do with common filler words (“the”, “is”, “and”).\n",
    "\n",
    "* For sentiment, some stopwords (like “not”) are critical.\n",
    "* So instead of removing all stopwords, remove only those that don’t affect sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Feature Extraction (Vectorization)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Convert text into numeric features that models can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Baseline methods**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Bag-of-Words (BoW)**: word counts.\n",
    "  * **TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)**: weights words by importance.\n",
    "* **Advanced methods**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Word embeddings (`Word2Vec`, `GloVe`) → capture word meaning.\n",
    "  * Transformer embeddings (e.g., **BERT**, **DistilBERT**) → capture context.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Modeling**\n",
    "\n",
    "Train classifiers on those features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Baseline models**: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM).\n",
    "* **Advanced models**: fine-tune BERT for sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start simple (Logistic Regression + TF-IDF).\n",
    "* Iterate toward advanced (BERT fine-tuning) if time/resources allow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Measure performance with metrics aligned to the business goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Accuracy**: good for balanced data.\n",
    "* **Precision/Recall/F1**: better for imbalanced classes (especially negatives).\n",
    "* **Confusion Matrix**: see which classes the model confuses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Business Insights Layer**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once sentiment is predicted, cross-tabulate with `emotion_in_tweet_is_directed_at`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: *“40% of negative tweets are about the iPhone, while 70% of positive ones are about iPad apps.”*\n",
    "\n",
